	abstract = {Multilevel models are increasingly used in sociology and other social sciences to analyze variation of tie outcomes in egocentrically sampled network data, particularly in studies of social support. Existing research assumes that the personal networks in the data do not overlap (i.e., they do not have actors in common), which makes standard hierarchical models suitable for analysis. This assumption is unrealistic in certain sampling designs, including the case of egos sampled from higher level groups or via link-tracing methods. We describe different types of ego-network overlap and propose a method to detect overlapping actors and analyze the resulting data with cross-classified multilevel models. The method is demonstrated with an application to research on personal networks and social support among Hispanic immigrants in rural U.S. destinations. Overlap detection and modeling result in better model fit, more correct partition of tie variation among different sources, and the ability to test new substantive hypotheses.},

	abstract = {Egocentric network analysis is used widely across the social sciences, especially in anthropology, political science, economics, and sociology, and is increasingly being employed in communications, informatics, and business and marketing studies. Egocentric network analysis requires a unique set of data collection and analysis skills that overlap only minimally with other network methodologies. However, until now there has been no single reference for conceptualizing, collecting, and analyzing egocentric social network data. This comprehensive guide to study design, data collection, and analysis brings together the state of knowledge with the most effective research tools to guide newcomers to this field. It is illustrated with many engaging examples and graphics and assumes no prior knowledge. Covering the entire research process in a logical sequence, from conceptualizing research questions to interpreting findings, this volume provides a solid foundation for researchers at any stage of their career to learn and apply ego network methods.},

The authors provide solid guidance on the formulation of research questions; research design; data collection, including decisions about survey modes and sampling frames; the measurement of network composition and structure, including the use of name generators; and statistical modeling, from basic regression techniques to more advanced multilevel and dynamic models. Ethical issues in personal network research are addressed.

Multilevel modelling is now the accepted statistical technique for handling such data and is widely available in computer software packages. A thorough understanding of these techniques is therefore important for all those working in these areas. This new edition of Multilevel Statistical Models brings these techniques together, starting from basic ideas and illustrating how more complex models are derived. Bayesian methodology using MCMC has been extended along with new material on smoothing models, multivariate responses, missing data, latent normal transformations for discrete responses, structural equation modeling and survival models.  Key Features:  Provides a clear introduction and a comprehensive account of multilevel models. New methodological developments and applications are explored. Written by a leading expert in the field of multilevel methodology. Illustrated throughout with real-life examples, explaining theoretical concepts.  This book is suitable as a comprehensive text for postgraduate courses, as well as a general reference guide. Applied statisticians in the social sciences, economics, biological and medical disciplines will find this book beneficial.},
