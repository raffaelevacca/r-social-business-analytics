# Creating reproducible reports {#reproducible}

We'll do this live in class starting from RStudio's [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf). 

I'll use the Rmd file for this chapter to store a couple of code chunks you'll be especially interested in.

Load your packages and data:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

# For extra features with tables in final reports.
library(kableExtra)

# For interactive tables
library(DT)

# Clear the workspace
rm(list = ls())

# Let's load the data we cleaned in the previous chapter
load("my_data.rda")
```

Create a nice table with absolute frequencies:

```{r}
data |> 
  count(gen, gender) |> 
  kable() |> 
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

Create an interactive table (searchable and sortable):

```{r}
data |> 
  count(gen, gender) |> 
  DT::datatable()
```
